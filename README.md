# MangaGalaxy

MangaGalaxy is a lightweight Node.js web app designed for manga enthusiasts and artists. This application is perfect for manga lovers who want to showcase their work or enjoy reading their favorite stories in a convenient, on-the-go format. The best part? It doesn't require a database and organizes everything neatly in folders.


## Story Behind MangaGalaxy

MangaGalaxy was created with a simple yet heartfelt purposeâ€”to provide a special platform for my little sister, who is an aspiring manga artist. She needed a tool that would allow her to easily preview her artwork and stories, all while being able to move the app to different locations effortlessly. 

Seeing her passion and dedication, I decided to develop MangaGalaxy, a portable and user-friendly solution tailored to her needs. Now, it's my hope that this app can be useful not only to her but to other manga creators and enthusiasts as well.
